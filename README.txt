This application contains five scenes. They are: Intro, RoomSelection, Homescreen, NewPinZiGame and maze. They are all stored under Assets/Scenes/, except for maze which is stored in Assets/Scenes/Archives/.

The Scripts are inside the Assets/Script/ folder.

By adding data in Assets/Resources/PinZiPianPang/PinZiData.json and ./Maze/CharSpawnerUTF.txt, the in-game content can be easily expanded. The sprites used for PinZiGame is also under Assets/Resources/PinZiPianPang/.

For optimization:
1. Implement object pooling in maze game.
2. Use less features of post-processing stack for HomeScreen and maze.
