If you encounter any strange issue when enabling the lightmap functionality of the shader, make sure you've baked the lightmaps correctly with proper settings. The demo scene can also encounter such issue if you import the package in different unity version than it was submitted with. In this case, please rebake the lightmap and it'll fix the issue.

If you have any questions or suggestions about the assets, please contact me.
